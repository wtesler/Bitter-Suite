Bitter-Suite - Coinbase interface.

-See CoinbaseClient.java for the main functionality of the program.

-See GuiMain.java and LayoutController.java for application GUI and lifecycle.

-See some examples in Tests.java.

-See mongo package for code related to our mongo database.

-Has dependencies on SimpleJson (https://code.google.com/p/json-simple/downloads/list), Jetty (included in libs).

--If Jetty screams about needing slf4j logging, then add this dependency http://www.slf4j.org/download.html .

- You DO NOT NEED mongo to run the application. It is only needed if you want to use classes inside the mongo package.
